     <h1>hey. it seems like you are using an Apple device.</h1>
     <h3>If you are not, please contact me.</h3>
</br></br>
     <h2>Now wait, why am I here instead of your normal website?</h2>
     <p>Apple is <b>not</b> a good corporation. They steal your money to sell you inferior products with features copied from other non-apple phones. Every year, when you buy a new phone, tablet or other device from Apple, you are supporting poor quality workmanship, abuse of power in Apple, and privacy violations.</p>
     <p>They are made purerly to take your money, and will use psychological tricks and dark patterns on you to make sure you buy a product from them.</p>
</br></br>
<h2>This sounds terrible, what can I do?</h2>
<p>You should consider buying an Android series of devices. Many popular brands that run on Android are Samsung, Google, Xiaomi, Huawei and many others.</p>
<p>Also, Android phones can be up to 80% cheaper than a new IPhone, and has 4x the processing power!</p>
 </br>
   <p>You can find good deals on Android phones at places like <a href="https://amazon.co.uk/" target="_blank">Amazon</a>, or check your local electronics retailer.</p>
</br></br>
<h2>How about my photos, contacts, etc.</h2>
<p>Android phones have functions that allow you to transfer <b>everything</b> from your apple device. Samsung and Google allow you to <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/1295296267926284" target="_blank">transfer WhatsApp messages</a> too!</p>
</br>
 </br>
   <h2>I need to access your website!</h2>
   <p>I am only allowing Android and non-Apple based devices to access my website. No can do.</p>
