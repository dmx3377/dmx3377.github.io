      <h2>"I'm here about the pictures!"</h2>
      <p>Sure. I am happy with you to use my image if you <strong>credit me.</strong> Use them on whatever you want - meme, in a PowerPoint presentation, show it to your friends <i>about how cool I am</i>, that kind of thing.</p>
    </br>
    </br>
      <p>I am <strong>NOT</strong> happy though if you publish my images elsewhere on the Internet without the proper credit. It hurts me, and it will eventually hurt you once I find it and file a copyright claim; so just don't do it.</p>
    </br>
      <p>I mostly publish the pictures I take onto <a href="https://x.com/dmx3377" target="_blank" ref="twitter">Twitter/X</a>, but you may find some ones that I haven't published in my <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/dmx3377/" target="_blank" ref="flickr">Flickr</a>.</p>

      <h2>Why is your username 'dmx3377'?</h2>
      <p>Long story. So in 2016 I made a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roblox" target="_blank" ref="roblox-explainer">Roblox</a> account, and decided to name it <i>DavidTDC3377.</i> It doesn't have a specific meaning, just my name with letters and random numbers.</p>
      <p>The account got banned in 2022, so I decided to create another account with a newer username, <i>DavidTheDev33777</i>, to pay homage to my old accounts number, 3377; while keeping it look new.</p>
      <p>Slowly over time, I changed to what you <i>might</i> know as 'd4vidthedev', and now I use 'dmx3377'. I don't really plan to change it anytime soonm though.</p>

      <h2>Contact me</h2>
      <p>If you need to contact me, best way is Twitter DM. But if you hate Twitter, you can also <a href="mailto:d4vidthedev@gmail.com" ref="email">email</a> me.</p>
      <p>or if you use Guilded, send me a message there. My username is <i>d4v1d</i>.</p>
      <i>P.S.: This is not my personal email; I check this less frequently, so I might not reply as quickly as on Twitter. Bear that in mind.</i>
